The idea was a time lapse. As they do it
in a lot of eco promotional animations. I love working with different colors, and at this point
of my life I enjoy brightness and a happyness stimulating themes. A summer is also a great time for a rainbow colors. I am also abso- lutely addicted to vector drawing. So you can tell, I did a lot of it in
this work. SF Rock
