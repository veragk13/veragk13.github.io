                Candy World!
It was my favorite project to work on.
My idea was a goofy little creature that loves candies ( just as much as I do). I can easy say it sort of re ects on my daily diet routine. The
hardest was a backround,  nding the right color that would create a feeling of a complete cartoon. My plan is to cre-
at a little app in similar theme,
shoud be fun.
