        Why am I taking VDM 105?
I want to become UX Designer and
work in the tech company in the city. I would like the company to be fashion oriented. ( That would be a dream come true. I always enjoyed
drawing and sketching. If everything goes well I hope to get employed by next
        summer! Very Excited! Good luck to me!  </p>
